# Zora Agent Skills

Agent skills for the Zora attention market. Skill gallery, live market data, leaderboards, and machine-readable API docs.

**Not** an execution platform, custody layer, or marketplace. Execution is local to the user's agent runtime. We don't hold keys, submit transactions, or enforce guardrails server-side.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) with TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- **shadcn/ui v2** — uses `@base-ui/react` (NOT Radix)
- **React Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) for client-side caching
- **@zoralabs/coins-sdk v0.4.7** for all Zora protocol data
- **pnpm** for package management
- Deploy target: **Vercel**

## How to run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # dev server at localhost:3000
pnpm build        # production build (primary verification gate)
pnpm test         # vitest skill structure + data integrity tests
pnpm lint         # eslint
```

### Environment

Create `.env.local`:

```
ZORA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

The API key is **optional**. The SDK works without it (uses registered queries), but requests are rate-limited. Get a key from https://zora.co/settings/developer.

## Key decisions

- **Server components fetch initial data directly** through `src/lib/data.ts`, which wraps the SDK with `unstable_cache` and mock-data fallbacks. This keeps the first paint server-rendered without duplicating fetch logic.
- **Client components still refresh through API routes** (`/api/explore`, `/api/leaderboard`) using React Query. The API remains the public integration surface for external agents and local tooling.
- **Agent discovery is explicit** via `/api`, `/api/skills`, JSON-LD, and `/.well-known/ai.json`.
- **Skills are static data** in `src/lib/skills.ts`. No database, no CMS. The homepage grid and skills gallery both render from this array — add a skill to the array and both pages update automatically.
- **Install commands are agent instructions**, not CLI commands. The Zora CLI has no `install` or `skills` subcommand. Each runtime gets a prompt-based command: `claude -p "Read <url> and <action>"`. OpenClaw is the exception with `clawhub install <skill-id>`. The curl tab is the only real shell command.
- **SKILL.md is served from the domain** at `/skills/[id]/skill-md` (`src/app/skills/[id]/skill-md/route.ts`). This gives agent commands clean URLs that work in any environment.
- **Install commands are shared** from `src/lib/skills.ts` (`getSkillRuntimeCommands()`, `getInstallAllCommands()`) so the UI and `/api/skills` stay in sync.
- **The skills page has a unified install card** — `RuntimeInstallCard` in `src/components/skill-card-client.tsx` combines 6 runtime tabs (OpenClaw, Claude Code, Amp, Codex CLI, OpenCode, Cursor) with a copyable code snippet in one bordered card. OpenClaw is the default runtime. Per-skill rows use standalone `CopyableCodeBlock` components.
- **The skills page stays intentionally flat** — one shared runtime picker updates every command block. Only the example output is collapsible (with typewriter animation). No nested accordions.
- **Tabs use a single unified style** — `TabsList` always renders with `bg-muted p-1` (gray container) and selected tabs get black fill + white text. No variants — one style for all tab UIs (skills picker, homepage terminal, portfolio, dashboard). The preferred pattern is a wrapper `<div className="border-b border-border bg-muted p-1">` around `<TabsList className="grid ... bg-transparent p-0">`. **Gotcha:** The base `TabsList` component has `justify-center` baked in. `cn()` / tailwind-merge will NOT remove it when you pass `flex w-full` — you must explicitly add `justify-start` to left-align tabs, or use `grid` layout which avoids the issue.
- **Route-level `loading.tsx` files** exist for `/`, `/dashboard`, and `/leaderboard` — the three routes with async SDK fetches. These render instant skeleton states during navigation so the site feels like a fast SPA. Static pages (`/skills`, `/portfolio`) don't need them.
- **No `config.schema.json`** for skills. Config is documented inline in SKILL.md files, following AgentSkills/OpenClaw conventions. Runtime config (requires, tunables) lives in `clawhub.json`.
- **Command menu is lazy-loaded** through `src/components/command-menu-loader.tsx` so it does not affect the initial page payload.
- **React Query** handles live refresh after hydration. Initial render is server-owned for `/`, `/dashboard`, and `/leaderboard`.
- **Homepage "Agent activity" is a terminal board**, not a 4-card grid. It preloads 8 rows per tab, refreshes through `/api/explore` and `/api/leaderboard`, and uses a subtle CRT-style loading sweep plus simulated preview motion between fetches.
- **Activity ticker shows mock agent trades** — Simmer-style marquee (`@AgentName bought $12 Higher 3m ago`), rendered on the homepage only (`src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/loading.tsx`). Positioned with negative margins to sit flush below the fixed nav in the `pt-20` gap. Mock data in `src/lib/activity-mock-data.ts` with `TradeActivityItem` interface. Green for buys, magenta for sells. Will swap to real trade data when tracking is available.
- **Portfolio page is mock data only** — `src/lib/portfolio-mock-data.ts` provides all positions, trades, PnL stats, and sparkline data. No real wallet connection. Will be replaced with live data when trade history indexing ships.
- **Wallet connect gates the portfolio** — `PortfolioAuthGate` redirects disconnected users to `/`. The nav conditionally shows the Portfolio link based on `isConnected`. Connecting a wallet seeds default skills (`trend-scout`, `portfolio-scout`); disconnecting clears them.
- **Wallet menu uses the same overlay pattern as the Index** — `fixed inset-0 z-[100]`, split backdrop/content transitions (200ms blur, 100ms content snap), rendered outside the `<header>` to avoid `inert` conflicts. Brutalist design: `gap-px` grid cells, QR code spanning rows, condensed bold `font-display` for balance.
- **Skill cards use `peer/link` for hover isolation** — `SkillCard` places an absolute `<Link>` as `peer/link` at z-0 and buttons at z-10. The card inverts on `peer-hover/link:` but button hover/click does not trigger the card's hover state.
- **Agent profiles use mock PnL data** — `src/lib/agent-mock-data.ts` provides mock positions, trades, and sparkline for agent profile pages. Real profile data (holdings, created coins) comes from the SDK.
- **PnL utilities are shared** — `src/lib/pnl-utils.ts` exports `pnlColor()`, `formatPnl()`, `formatPct()` used by both portfolio and agent profile pages. Gains = `#3FFF00`, losses = `#FF00F0`.
- **Market colors stay full-strength** — use `#3FFF00`, `#FF00F0`, or no market color at all. Only neutral grays should be faded with opacity.
- **Hover media overlay** — Inspired by hausotto.com. When hovering a coin row in `CoinTable` or `HomeLiveCards`, the token's `mediaContent.previewImage.medium` is shown as a large image centered on the viewport (`fixed inset-0 z-50`). Uses `pointer-events: none` so hover detection stays on the table rows. Disabled on touch devices via `(pointer: fine)` media query check in `useHasPointer()` hook (`useSyncExternalStore`-based, SSR-safe). The overlay fades in after the image loads (`loadedUrl === imageUrl` check prevents stale flashes). Mock data in `src/lib/mock-data.ts` includes picsum.photos URLs for dev testing.
- **Animated highlighter stroke** — `HighlighterStroke` component (`src/components/highlighter-stroke.tsx`) animates a `#3FFF00` background sweep left-to-right using motion/react `backgroundSize` with `ease-out-quint` easing, subtle `scaleY` press from bottom-left, and `-1.5deg` skew for a hand-drawn feel. Used on hero headings. The `.highlight-block` CSS class provides the static base styles (color, padding, `box-decoration-break: clone`); the component overrides `background-color` to transparent and drives the background via inline `backgroundImage` + animated `backgroundSize`. A `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS exemption in `globals.css` prevents the blanket `transition-duration: 0.01ms !important` rule from killing the motion/react animation. Portfolio stat numbers still use the static `.highlight-block` class directly.

## Tone of voice

All user-facing copy follows the guidelines in `TONE.md`. Key rules:

- Zora is an "attention market". Use this phrase as the definitive description.
- Short, direct sentences. Lead with the fact, not the framing.
- Trend-focused: trending coins, momentum, volume. Creator coins exist but are not the primary lens.
- No promotional adjectives ("fast-moving", "powerful", "seamless").
- No forced rule-of-three lists. Use the natural number of items.
- No em dashes in marketing copy. Use commas or periods.
- No developer jargon in user-facing text ("execution-capable flows", "install surface").
- "Execution skills" not "execution-capable skills". "Points to" not "resolves to".
- Speculation should be tasteful and optimistic, never overpromise.

## Animated buttons with icons

Buttons that contain icons must animate those icons on hover. Use `AnimatedButton` from `@/components/ui/animated-button` instead of the base `Button` or `buttonVariants` for any button with an icon child.

```tsx
import { AnimatedButton } from "@/components/ui/animated-button";
import { PlusIcon } from "@/components/ui/plus";

<AnimatedButton variant="outline" onClick={handleClick}>
  <PlusIcon size={14} />
  Add item
</AnimatedButton>
```

The `AnimatedButton` component automatically detects icon children (components with `displayName` ending in "Icon") and wires their `startAnimation`/`stopAnimation` methods to mouse enter/leave events. The icons use motion/react for smooth animations.

For links styled as buttons with icons, use `AnimatedArrowLink` from `@/components/animated-arrow-link`.

## shadcn/ui v2 — critical gotcha

shadcn/ui v2 uses `@base-ui/react` instead of Radix. The `Button` component does **not** support `asChild`.

Wrong:
```tsx
<Button asChild><Link href="/foo">Go</Link></Button>
```

Correct:
```tsx
import { buttonVariants } from "@/components/ui/button-variants"

<Link href="/foo" className={buttonVariants({ variant: "outline" })}>Go</Link>
```

Import `buttonVariants` from `@/components/ui/button-variants` for server-safe usage with `<Link>`. The interactive `<Button>` component still lives in `@/components/ui/button`.

## Nav overlay transition pattern

The Index menu overlay uses split transitions for a snappy-but-smooth feel:

- **Content** (section grid + logo): `transition-[transform,opacity] duration-100 ease-out` — snaps in/out fast (100ms). High-frequency interaction = minimal animation per Emil's frequency principle.
- **Backdrop** (blur + tint): `transition-[opacity,backdrop-filter] duration-200 ease-out` — eases blur smoothly at 200ms. Blur filters need more time to avoid choppy rendering.
- **Navigation links**: `onClick` calls `navigateWithClose()` which closes the menu first, then fires `router.push()` after 100ms so the close transition completes before the page changes.

The parent wrapper has no transition — it only toggles `pointer-events`. Opacity lives on the content and backdrop independently so they can run at different speeds.

## Modal layering gotcha

The wallet connect modal hit a subtle CSS painting-order bug. Inside `src/components/wallet-connect-modal.tsx`, the backdrop is `absolute`. When the panel wrapper was non-positioned, the backdrop painted above it even though the panel markup came later in the DOM.

Fix: make the panel wrapper a positioned element with `relative`.

```tsx
<div className="relative flex h-full items-center justify-center pointer-events-none">
```

Do not assume DOM order alone will put modal content above an `absolute` sibling. If the backdrop and panel live in the same stacking context, make sure the panel container is positioned.

## SDK parameter inconsistencies

The `@zoralabs/coins-sdk` functions use different parameter names. These are documented here because they caused build failures during initial development:

| Function | Parameters | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| `getTrendingAll` | `{ count }` | |
| `getCoinsMostValuable` | `{ count }` | |
| `getCoinsNew` | `{ count }` | |
| `getCoinsTopVolume24h` | `{ count }` | |
| `getCoinsTopGainers` | `{ count }` | |
| `getCreatorCoins` | `{ count }` | |
| `getFeaturedCreators` | `{ first }` | NOT `count` |
| `getTraderLeaderboard` | `{ first }` | NOT `count` |
| `getCoin` | `{ address, chain }` | chain is number (8453 for Base) |
| `getCoinSwaps` | `{ address, chain, first }` | `chain` is number, `first` not `count` |
| `getCoinHolders` | `{ chainId, address, count }` | `chainId` not `chain` |
| `getProfileBalances` | `{ identifier, count }` | `identifier` is wallet address |
| `getProfileCoins` | `{ identifier, count }` | `identifier` is wallet address |

All SDK responses return `{ error, data }`. Always check `response.error` before accessing data.

## Skills

5 first-party verified skills:

1. **Trend Scout** — trending topic coins, new trend launches, volume and mcap leaders
2. **Creator Pulse** — creator coin ecosystems, featured creators, watchlists
3. **Briefing Bot** — structured morning/evening market digest
4. **Portfolio Scout** — coin holdings via CLI (local wallet) or SDK (any address). Bankr-ready bridge skill
5. **Momentum Trader** — auto-buys trending Zora coins on momentum signals via Zora CLI. Execution-capable — requires dedicated trader wallet created with `zora setup`.

Skills 1–4 are read-only (no wallet needed). Skill 5 is execution-capable via the Zora CLI's native wallet and buy/sell commands. All use OpenClaw SKILL.md format. The CLI has no SKILL.md parsing — it's purely an agent-runtime convention.

### Skill directory structure

Each skill follows the AgentSkills/ClawHub directory convention:

```
<skill-slug>/
├── SKILL.md          # AgentSkills-compliant metadata + agent instructions
├── clawhub.json      # ClawHub registry config (requires, tunables, cron)
└── scripts/
    └── validate.sh   # Structural validation script
```

**SKILL.md frontmatter** uses the AgentSkills format — flat `metadata` strings only:
```yaml
---
name: <skill-slug>          # must match directory name
description: <max 1024 chars>
metadata:
  author: "Zora Agent Skills"
  version: "1.0.0"
  displayName: "<Human Name>"
  difficulty: "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
---
```

Do NOT put `requires`, `tunables`, or `openclaw` in SKILL.md frontmatter — those go in `clawhub.json`.

**SKILL.md body** must contain these 8 sections in order:
1. `## When to Use This Skill`
2. `## Setup`
3. `## Configuration`
4. `## Commands`
5. `## How It Works`
6. `## Example Output`
7. `## Troubleshooting`
8. `## Important Notes`

**clawhub.json** structure:
- Read-only skills: `requires.bins: ["zora"]`, no `requires.env`
- Execution skills: add `requires.env: ["ZORA_API_KEY", "ZORA_PRIVATE_KEY"]` and `tunables` array
- All skills include `"automaton": {"managed": false, "entrypoint": null}` — signals to OpenClaw runtimes that these are CLI wrappers, not standalone scripts

### Skill testing

Run `pnpm test` to validate all skills against the AgentSkills spec. Tests cover:
- SKILL.md frontmatter fields and format
- Required body sections present
- Word count 300–800 per skill
- CLI flag correctness (`--json` for explore/get/balances, `-o json` for buy/sell)
- clawhub.json schema validation
- Cross-file sync (skills.ts IDs match SKILL.md names and directory names)
- Execution skill safety (risk levels, buy/sell wraps, env requirements)

### CLI commands

The Zora CLI has 8 commands: `auth`, `explore`, `get`, `buy`, `sell`, `balances`, `setup`, `wallet`.

| Command | Syntax | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `zora explore` | `--sort <sort> --type <type> --limit <n> --json` | Sorts: mcap, volume, new, gainers, trending, featured, last-traded, last-traded-unique. Types: all, trend, creator-coin, post |
| `zora get` | `zora get <identifier> [--type <type>] --json` | Identifier = 0x address or creator name. NOT ENS. Types: creator-coin, post, trend |
| `zora buy` | `zora buy <address> --eth <amount> -o json` | Uses `-o json` (local flag), NOT `--json`. Also: --percent, --all, --quote (preview only), --yes (skip confirm) |
| `zora sell` | `zora sell <address> --amount <tokens> -o json` | Uses `-o json` (local flag), NOT `--json`. Also: --percent, --all, --to <ETH\|USDC\|ZORA>, --quote, --yes |
| `zora balances` | `zora balances --json` | **Local wallet only** — no address argument. Returns coin holdings (not native ETH/USDC/ZORA) |
| `zora setup` | `zora setup [--create] [--force]` | Creates/imports wallet at ~/.config/zora/wallet.json |
| `zora wallet` | `wallet info`, `wallet export`, `wallet backup` | Keychain-protected backup on macOS |
| `zora auth` | `auth configure`, `auth status` | API key management |

**CLI behavioral notes:**
- `--json` output is clean stdout. Errors go to stderr. In JSON mode, errors are also structured: `{"error": "...", "suggestion": "..."}`.
- Exit codes: 0 = success (including user abort), 1 = all errors.
- `--yes` skips the trade confirmation prompt only. Validation (API key, wallet, balance checks) still runs.
- `--sort` and `--type` combine (e.g., `--sort trending --type creator-coin`). Invalid combos return a clear error. Some sorts (`gainers`, `last-traded`, `last-traded-unique`) only support `--type post`.
- `zora get` returns `uniqueHolders` and `volume24h` but NOT swaps or detailed holder list. Use SDK `getCoinHolders`/`getCoinSwaps` for those.
- No watch/streaming mode. Single request, single response, exit.

**CLI JSON output shapes:**
- `explore --json`: `[{ name, address, coinType, marketCap, volume24h, marketCapDelta24h }]`
- `get --json`: `{ name, address, coinType, marketCap, volume24h, uniqueHolders, createdAt, creatorAddress, creatorHandle }`
- `balances --json`: `[{ name, symbol, coinType, address, balance, usdValue, priceUsd, marketCap, volume24h }]`
- `buy/sell --json`: `{ action, coin, address, spent/received, tx }` — `--quote` adds `estimated` and `slippage` instead of `tx`

**`zora balances` limitations:**
- Returns **coin holdings only** — balance, USD value, market cap, volume per coin. No native ETH/USDC/ZORA.
- **Local wallet only** — reads from configured private key, no address argument.
- For arbitrary wallet lookups, use SDK (`getProfileBalances`, `getProfileCoins`).
- Portfolio Scout wraps both: `zora balances` for the local wallet, SDK for any address.

### Wallet setup

- `zora setup` creates a new EOA keypair or imports an existing private key
- Keys stored at `~/.config/zora/wallet.json` (mode 0600)
- `ZORA_PRIVATE_KEY` env var takes precedence over stored wallet
- `--create` skips interactive prompt, `--force` overwrites existing wallet
- **No spending limits or scope restrictions** — it's a raw private key

## Agent-facing endpoints

- `/api` — discovery document listing public endpoints
- `/api/skills` — full skill catalog JSON
- `/api/skills?id=<skill-id>` — single skill lookup
- `/api/explore` — live explore data with cache headers
- `/api/leaderboard` — leaderboard data with cache headers
- `/api/agents/<address>` — agent profile data (balances, coins, volume, rank)
- `/skills/<id>/skill-md` — raw SKILL.md content (`text/markdown`, 1h cache)
- `/.well-known/ai.json` — simple discovery document for crawlers and agents

## Product boundaries

- Execution skills (Momentum Trader) run locally via Zora CLI — we don't execute trades server-side
- No custody or key management
- No server-side enforcement or guardrails
- No third-party skill submissions
- No paid features or tokens
- Verification = we reviewed published source. Does not mean we control local runtime.
